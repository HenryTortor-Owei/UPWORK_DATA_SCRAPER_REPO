Developing Novel LLM for EEG Report Generation Using Kuramoto Models and Supersymmetry,"['AI Model Development', 'AI Instruction', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'AI Development', 'AI Model Training', 'PyTorch', 'Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Large Language Model', 'Multimodal Large Language Model']",-,Expert,Hourly,30+ hrs/week,"Our cutting-edge healthcare AI startup is seeking a highly skilled and innovative AI researcher to join our team on a contract basis. The primary objective of this project is to develop a groundbreaking large language model (LLM) specifically designed for automated EEG report generation and interpretation by leveraging Kuramoto models and principles of supersymmetry.

Our hypothesis is that by representing words and their relationships within the framework of the Kuramoto model, we can capture rich linguistic dynamics and synchronization patterns. Each word will be treated as an oscillator with intrinsic frequencies and coupling strengths determined by factors such as semantic similarity and co-occurrence statistics. We posit that the collective dynamics of these word oscillators, as governed by the Kuramoto equations, will give rise to emergent language structures and context-aware representations.

To further enhance the expressive power of our model, we propose integrating supersymmetry, a concept originating from theoretical physics. By mapping the synchronized states of word oscillators to a supersymmetric space, we aim to capture higher-order relationships and abstract features that are not accessible through standard language modeling approaches. The supersymmetric formulation will allow for the encoding of complementary linguistic properties, akin to the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in physical systems.

Key Responsibilities:

1. Research and develop innovative LLM architectures that incorporate Kuramoto oscillator dynamics and supersymmetric representations for EEG data.
2. Implement and train the LLM on large datasets of EEG recordings and corresponding medical reports.
3. Collaborate with our interdisciplinary team of AI experts, neuroscientists, and medical professionals to refine the model and ensure clinical relevance.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and expert evaluations of generated reports.
5. Document the developed methodologies, experimental designs, and findings in high-quality research papers and technical reports.
6. Present research outcomes at conferences, workshops, and internal meetings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Preferred Qualifications:

1. Familiarity with Kuramoto models and their applications to neural networks.
2. Knowledge of supersymmetry and its potential for enhancing AI systems.
3. Prior work on graph representation learning.
4. Experience with medical NLP and domain-specific language models.
5. Track record of open-source contributions and community involvement.

The code for the network is already available in PyTorch.  
We would like to use quantization in the forward path, and Straight Through Estimator (STE) in the backwards path. For the forward path, the rules is as follows: 
torch.clamp(torch.round(self.fc1(x) / s), min=-qumin, max=qumax) * s 
Where ‘s’ is the scaling factor, and qumin and qumax are the quantization minimum and maximum respectively (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08295) 
For the backward path, STE should be used in a way that keeps the weights in the wished range and clamp the weights that goes beyond our range. The desired range for the weights is [-2s, -1s, 0, 1s, s] where ‘s’ is the scaling factor. The value for ‘s’ can also be learned using the learned step size quantization, explained in https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153.

Exploring Benefits of Meditation Techniques,"['Meditation', 'Visualization', 'Mindfulness', 'Yoga', 'Yoga Instruction']","
        $50
      ",Entry level,Fixed-price,-,"We are looking for meditation / visualization app testers.

What we’re doing:

We’re testing out an app that we’ve developed called Time-Machine. Our goal is to see whether humans have the ability to visualize a future outcome while in a mildly meditative state. I know… it sounds a little crazy, but this does work, and the science behind it is really very deep. To date, we have collectively completed 3978 trials which have been 52% correct in predicting their respective future outcomes resulting in over 2.7 standard deviations from chance expectation. This translates to odds against chance of approximately 1 in 315.6. This means that such an outcome is highly unlikely to occur by random chance, indicating that the guesses (predictions) are not simply random.

Here is what the job entails:

At some point, once per day whenever you choose, you must spend at least 30 minutes in a mildly meditative state working your way through 10 trials performing some visualization tasks using the Time-Machine web app. We use an A.I. model to analyze your 10 trials to make 1 prediction. Therefore, 10 trials = 1 prediction.

You must use a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer. Due to the small screen, a smart phone is not acceptable.

Complete 1 prediction (10 trials) each day for 5 consecutive days, for a total of up to 5 predictions for the week.

This is what we will pay you based on your prediction success:

1 correct prediction out of 5 predictions = $5
2 correct predictions out of 5 predictions  = $5
3 correct predictions out of 5 predictions = $10
4 correct predictions out of 5 predictions = $25
5 correct predictions out of 5 predictions = $50

5 consecutive predictions completes the payment cycle. For example:
For Week 1, you complete a prediction on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
For Week 2, you complete a prediction on Monday.
This completes your set of 5 predictions and you will be paid based on the above incentive schedule.

Since the predictions are a binary choice, 50% correct is the mean. So, you should average at least 2.5 correct days each week if you are performing at average random chance. But I know that you will do better than that

For your 5 predictions, a milestone will be added in Upwork and funded with $5. Based on your prediction success for the 5 predictions, the milestone dollar amount will be adjusted and paid based on the above incentive schedule.

This job post is for 5 paid predictions. If you have a good handle on the process and are a high performer, a new milestone will be set up with 5 more paid predictions. If you complete 10 predictions and continue to be a high performer, there is an opportunity for a permanent position on our team (contingent on performance). That's right, you can be a professional time traveler! ;-)

Training:

If you accept, then I’ll hire you on Upwork.

From there, please provide me with your email and I'll send you a training package which consists of a bit of reading and a very short user guide video.

I look forward to you joining our team of “time travelers”!!

We will provide a suitable number of images and videos that have been manually labelled as one of the categories. We have access to thousands of images/videos; however, the manual labelling of the data takes time. We would first like to discuss the project in more detail with a suitable candidate before deciding what a sufficient sample of training data is.

You may use whichever Machine Learning framework suits you best, although experience with Computer Vision and Supervised Learning is essential. The timeframe is 1-3 months.

The final model should be robust to a wide variety of images and short-form videos, across different styles and several specified languages (including English, Hindi, Arabic). It should be usable by non-experts on local machines, allowing them to provide a collection of images and videos to receive feedback from the model specifying what percentage is storytelling content.

Optimize Python Script Performance / Speed ( CSV / Postgres),"['Python', 'PostgreSQL Programming', 'PostgreSQL']","
        $80
      ",Expert,Fixed-price,-,"Hi,

Need a python expert to optimize performance / speed of my current working python file. 

This Python script is designed to compare two CSV files containing product data and update a PostgreSQL database accordingly. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

Import necessary libraries: The script imports the required libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, psycopg2 for connecting to PostgreSQL, numpy for numerical operations, argparse for command-line argument parsing, logging for logging messages, and datetime for working with date and time.
Parse command-line arguments: The script uses argparse to parse command-line arguments, including the paths to the old and new CSV files, and the host URL to specify the source of the CSV data.
Define database configuration: The script defines the database configuration for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
Define helper functions: The script defines several helper functions:
preprocess_data: This function preprocesses the CSV data by converting column names to lowercase, handling missing values, converting the 'instock' column to a boolean, and cleaning the 'imageurl' column.
datetime_str_diff_seconds: This function calculates the difference in seconds between two datetime strings.
get_latest_updatedat: This function retrieves the maximum value of the 'updatedat' column from the new CSV file for a given host.
log_change: This function logs changes (insertions, deletions, and updates) to the product_changes_log table in the database.
log_sale: This function logs a sale for a given host if the 'updatedat' value in the new CSV file is newer than the old 'updatedat' value.
Load and preprocess CSV data: The script loads the old and new CSV files using pandas and preprocesses the data using the preprocess_data function.
Connect to the PostgreSQL database: The script establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the provided configuration.
Compare CSV files and update the database: The script performs the following operations:
Identifies added, deleted, and updated products by comparing the old and new CSV files.
Inserts new products into the host_track table.
Deletes products from the host_track table using a temporary table.
Updates existing products in the host_track table if there are any changes in the data.
Logs changes (insertions, deletions, and updates) to the product_changes_log table.
Logs a sale if the 'updatedat' value in the new CSV file is newer than the old 'updatedat' value and a sale has not been logged for the current run.
Updates the 'updatedat' value in the host_track table for all products associated with the given host.
Close the database connection: Finally, the script closes the database connection and logs a message indicating that the connection has been closed.
In summary, this script is designed to keep a PostgreSQL database synchronized with product data from CSV files. It compares the old and new CSV files, identifies changes (additions, deletions, and updates), and updates the database accordingly while logging the changes and potential sales.


My script is working perfectly right now, but it takes some time to run when we have 2 big CSV files ( 3000 lines or more ) , with a lot of changes to log or process.

What I expect:
1- write ""IREAD"" when applying for consideration
2- you will have to optimize the script's performance. this includes : using batch SQL instead of single queries where needed, find a better way to process the CSV files when they're large.

Right now, my script takes 4 min or so on CSV files with 7000 lines,  where all lines need to be updated. I expect you to reduce this time to at MAX 1 min . 

I'll be providing:
- the python script
- some CSV files for testing


I expect you to finish the work within 24 hours.

Thanks"

camera AI to detect plastic in organic matter in conveyor belt,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Python', 'TensorFlow', 'Computer Vision']",-,Expert,Hourly: $32-$70,Less than 30 hrs/week,"Develop and integrate an AI-powered system into our live camera setup to detect plastics within flowers and bouquets as they pass through a conveyor belt system. The primary goal is to identify and segregate plastic materials to ensure the flowers and organic matter can be recycled into compost efficiently, supporting our sustainability and recycling initiatives.

AI Model Development: Develop a computer vision model capable of recognizing and distinguishing plastic materials from organic flower matter. The model should adapt to various plastic types and forms (e.g., wrappings, ribbons).
Integration with Existing Systems: The AI model needs to be integrated with the live camera system installed above the conveyor belt. This integration should allow for real-time analysis of the materials as they pass through the belt.
Speed and Accuracy: The system must process images in real time, with minimal delay, ensuring high accuracy to minimize false positives (organic matter marked as plastic) and false negatives (plastics missed by the system).
Alerts and Reporting: Upon detection of plastic, the system should trigger an alert or a mechanism for separating the detected item from the organic flow. Additionally, a report summarizing daily detections and system accuracy is required for continuous improvement.
User Interface: Develop a simple, user-friendly interface for system monitoring and control. This should include live feed viewing, detection overlays, and system status (active, error states).
Testing and Validation: Conduct extensive testing with various flowers and plastics to train the model effectively. This includes gathering a diverse dataset for model training and validation.
Compliance and Data Handling: Ensure all software and data handling complies with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.
Technology Stack Suggestions:

AI and Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Detectron2, YOLO for model development. Consider Roboflow for data preparation and model training.
Camera and Hardware Integration: Use OpenCV for image processing and integration with the camera feed.
Interface Development: Recommend using a lightweight framework that supports real-time data visualization (e.g., Flask, Django for Python).

A fully integrated AI-powered detection system capable of identifying plastics in real-time, with high accuracy, facilitating the efficient recycling of organic matter.
Documentation detailing the system design, development process, and user guide.

      ",Intermediate,Fixed-price,-,"Hello,

I would like you to make a presentation given a data set and specifications.
You are provided with a dataset containing records of bid requests, bid responses, and impressions from a specific time period.
- The dataset includes discrepancies, such as differences between the number of bid responses sent and the number of impressions recorded.
- You must analyze the data to identify potential causes for these discrepancies
 (e.g., network issues, integration errors, data processing delays).
- You should develop a report outlining your findings, including visualizations that  highlight the discrepancies and their hypotheses about the underlying causes.

 The dataset simulates a day's worth of data from a digital advertising platform engaging in real-time bidding (RTB). It includes columns for timestamp, bid request ID, bid response ID, impression ID (if an impression occurred), and additional metadata such as the device, location, and bid amount. For simplification, the dataset structure is  outlined below with highlighted discrepancies to be identified.
 Dataset Structure:
 ● Timestamp: The time at which the bid request was made.
 ● BidRequestID: A unique identifier for the bid request.
 ● BidResponseID: A unique identifier for the bid response (this can be null if no response was made).
 ● ImpressionID: A unique identifier for the impression (if an impression occurred;  this can be null if no impression was recorded).
 ● Device: The device category (e.g., mobile, desktop).
 ● Location: The geographical location of the request.
 ● BidAmount: The amount bid for the ad placement (in USD)

 You are expected to:
● Perform an initial data exploration to understand the basic characteristics of the
 dataset.
 ● Identify the discrepancies mentioned above using appropriate data analysis
 techniques (e.g., filtering, aggregation, visualization).
 ● Illustrate the data analysis performed on a dedicated tab / sheet
 ● Formulate hypotheses for each identified discrepancy. For example, for the high bid response but low impression rate for mobile devices, a candidate might  hypothesize that ad size or format incompatibilities are causing rendering issues on mobile.
 ● Proposeactionable insights or solutions based on their hypotheses. This might  include suggesting checks for ad compatibility with mobile devices, reviewing  geo-targeting settings, or investigating the integrity of bid request-response
 logging

The dataset has approximately 1500 entries and in a csv format.

Personalization and curation ai algorithms,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Neural Network', 'Computer Vision', 'Artificial Neural Network']",-,Intermediate,Hourly: $17-$40,Less than 30 hrs/week,"Hi,
I have developed a mobile app for sports fans. Now it is time to increase its technical capabilities. 
I have a general set of questions and requirements.

Our app aggregates content.  We have apis to major social platforms and new sources.  Right now we don’t do much personalization.  We have simply linked given sources to teams.   We have linked sources to a general feed.  We thus have a lot of content coming in and simply put it in a general feed or a team feed.
My goal is to take in all the content and personalize.  This means users select favorite teams and players and perhaps another dimension.  We intake content, then decide if and where it should be displayed. As example an article may have destination in all users with the team mentioned in source content, as well as in the feed on important players mentioned in the content.  This is step .
Step 2 is being able to recommend content based on user behavior on our site.  I am interested in how to create this environment where we begin to identify content before we place in feed, treat all content as agnostic upon its arrival with emphasis on determining if and where it should be placed,  and finally a longer term strategy to personalize content at a higher level.
Any insight you have and experiences or solutions that you can submit to help me make decisions would be very appreciated.

Mathematics to analyze variable sensitivity between two syntax trees,"['Differential Calculus', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Mathematics', 'Algorithm Development', 'Calculus', 'Equations', 'Python']",-,Expert,Hourly,Less than 30 hrs/week,"I need expert help defining the mathematical basis for an algorithm I'm developing. I may even need help to frame the problem.

Given an equation of any form, I have a set of two variable substitutions. For example, if the equation is x^y, I have the substitutions (x=2, y=4) and (x=3, y=5). The result f(x,y) for each case is 16 and 243 respectively. I want a way to algorithmically determine the ranking of the magnitude of each variable's contribution to the difference.

In this example, the fact that y jumps from 4 to 5 has a much stronger effect on the final difference from 16 to 243 than does the jump of x from 2 to 3. So the ranking is [y,x] (ideally along with a numeric score for each). For a different substitution pair, such as [(2,4), (100,5)], the ranking is [x,y]. 

What do I call and how do I measure this ""sensitivity/contribution/weight"" so that I can rank it? It feels like it's a calculus problem, but partial derivatives didn't work for me in this context (I could be wrong).

Bonus points:
1. It would be even better if I could do this for an arbitrary number of substitutions, beyond just applying this process to all 1:1 permutations. Could I extract information that can be formulated across the body of all substitutions? For example, what are the prevailing variable strengths overall, or which variable is causing the most disturbance? (Vague concepts, but that's why I need help to even formulate the problem).
2. Provide ideas on how this problem could be generalized even further.
3. Use Python Sympy

I would like someone with a strong mathematical and algorithmic background to help formulate the mathematical foundation for this and to explain it to me so I can implement the algorithm."

      ",Intermediate,Fixed-price,-,"Hello, you are being requested to take part in a survey of 25 - 30 minutes for academic research purposes. Once you begin the survey, you have up to 72 hours to complete it, beyond which time the survey platform will mark your responses as incomplete. Please pay attention to all the questions.   

Since many established resources for employees such as organizational support or supervisors do not apply to freelancers, this study intends to help freelancers with strategies to have a better freelancing experience on Upwork or other comparable platforms. We will use your answers to guide new and experienced freelancers on building their profiles on labor platforms like Upwork and managing their freelancing career, as well as suggest improvements to the platforms and to policymakers. If you are interested, we can provide you with a brief summary of our major findings from our completed research study once our research is complete (tentatively August 2025 or earlier), after contacting you via Upwork.

We welcome freelancers across experience levels, earnings, and ratings who:
(i) provide freelancing services on their own (not as part of an agency or company),
(ii) are over 18 years of age,
(iii) have provided freelancing services for more than 1 year on Upwork,
(iv) have worked on freelancing projects in the past 1 year on Upwork (consider July 2022-June 2023 as the past 1 year), and
(iv) have a Job Success Score on their profile.

If you meet all the criteria listed above, please respond to this online survey job posting only if you consent to participating in this survey and allowing us to use certain details from your public Upwork profile for statistical purposes.

Procedure: In this survey you will not have any more risks than you have in normal life. This study has been approved by the researchers' institutional research ethics board.

You will not be personally identified in our analysis or reporting. While storing the data from the survey, a participant ID number will be used instead of your name. However, we will collect some information from your public Upwork profile with your consent (e.g., ratings, job category, total earnings, number of jobs, number of successfully completed jobs and jobs in progress, hourly rate, pricing strategy (fixed vs. hourly), profile title and keywords, number of reviews, type of recognition badge, number of years of educational and work experience, number of skill tags, country, gender, job success score, availability of  portfolio, testimonials, certifications, availability badge, and profile video) to understand the difference in freelance experience. Profile information that is captured from your public profile on Upwork with your consent, will be depersonalized for data analysis and reporting so that it is not identifiable with your details and will only be recorded against your participant ID number. These details and your responses will be kept confidential and used for academic purposes only. This study has been approved by the researchers' institutional research ethics board. Data will be stored in a secure academic database on university-licensed cloud storage to ensure confidentiality.

Please use a laptop or tablet to complete the survey. We recommend not using mobile.

Compensation: You will receive $8 for your participation. Kindly note, you will be compensated upon completion of the entire interview as per standard Upwork processes. At the end of the survey, you will be provided with a random ID number (numerical code) that will need to be shared with us on Upwork Message. This will enable us to process your compensation via the Upwork platform, as per standard Upwork processes.

You can stop participating in the survey at any time.
